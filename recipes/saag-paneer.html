    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Saag paneer is a classic Indian dish of cooked spinach studded with cubes of fried paneer cheese. Thickened with cream or coconut milk, it's a hearty and filling vegetarian meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 bunches spinach, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch fenugreek leaves, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
        <li>Â½ pound paneer, cubed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil; add spinach and fenugreek and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Drain well; transfer to a food processor and blend until finely chopped, about 5 pulses.</li>

        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add paneer cubes and fry until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer paneer onto a plate.</li>

        <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons canola oil in the same skillet over medium heat; add cumin seeds and fry until lightly toasted and aromatic, about 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and stir to coat. Stir in tomato, garam masala, turmeric, and cayenne pepper; cook until tomato breaks down, stirring often, about 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Stir in pureed spinach mixture, paneer cubes, and cream; add salt to taste. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    </ol>
